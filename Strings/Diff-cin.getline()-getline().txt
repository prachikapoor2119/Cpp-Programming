Key Differences
Type of Storage:

std::getline stores input in a std::string, which manages memory automatically and can grow in size.

std::cin.getline stores input in a C-style character array, which requires a predetermined size.


Flexibility:

std::getline is generally more flexible and easier to use, especially for variable-length input.

std::cin.getline can be less convenient due to fixed buffer sizes and manual memory management.



Delimiters:

Both functions allow for custom delimiters, but the way they are specified is different.



Summary
Use std::getline for reading into std::string and when you want flexibility and ease of use.


Use std::cin.getline when you need to read into a fixed-size character array.


Input parameters of cin.getline

Parameters:

s: A pointer to a character array (C-style string) where the input will be stored.
n: The maximum number of characters to read, including the null terminator (\0).
Description: This version reads characters from the input stream until a newline character is encountered or until n - 1 characters are read. It appends a null terminator at the end of the string.

with custom delimeter

s: A pointer to a character array where the input will be stored.
n: The maximum number of characters to read, including the null terminator.
delim: A character that acts as the delimiter. Reading stops when this character is encountered.
Description: This version  reads characters from the input stream until the specified delimiter is encountered or until n - 1 characters are read. It also appends a null terminator.
